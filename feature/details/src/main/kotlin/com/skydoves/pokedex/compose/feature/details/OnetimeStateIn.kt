 * preventing re-execution no matter how many times it's subscribed.
 * After the initial emission, it will simply replay the latest cached value.
 *
 * @param scope the coroutine scope in which sharing is started.
 * @param stopTimeout configures a delay (in milliseconds) between the disappearance of the last
 * subscriber and the stopping of the sharing coroutine. It defaults to zero (stop immediately).
 * @param replayExpiration configures a delay (in milliseconds) between the stopping of
 * the sharing coroutine and the resetting of the replay cache (which makes the cache empty for the
 * [shareIn] operator and resets the cached value to the original `initialValue`
 * for the [stateIn] operator). It defaults to `Long.MAX_VALUE` (keep replay cache forever,
 * never reset buffer). Use zero value to expire the cache immediately.
 * @param initialValue the initial value of the state flow. This value is also used when the
 * state flow is reset using the [SharingStarted]. [WhileSubscribed] strategy with the
 * [replayExpiration] parameter.
